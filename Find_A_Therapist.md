# Find A Therapist

https://sojoai.com/findatherapist/

To search for a qualified music therapist in your area, click in the dropdown list to highlight MT-BC in the "Music Therapy Credential" field if you are seeking a professional music therapist (students will appear in your results if you do not take this step), add any other search criteria you require, and click "Search."  You are most likely to find those members accepting clients by including "Self/Employed/Private Practice" from the settings list. It is best to keep search criteria broad for the most inclusive list. For example, start your search by simply looking for individuals with music therapy credentials in your entire state. Individuals may travel to your area and most music therapists are trained to work with multiple populations and settings so it is not necessary to include these details below unless you wish to narrow your search query.
